- Audit logging of all data access
- Unauthorized access monitoring

### Principle 5: Everyone must understand their responsibilities

**Framework Implementation:**
- Clear documentation of data handling requirements
- Staff responsibility documentation
- Compliance training recommendations

### Principle 6: Comply with the law

## Implementation Guidance

To ensure compliance with these NHS requirements, organizations should:

1. **Establish Ownership:** Assign clear responsibility for data governance
2. **Regular Assessment:** Use the framework for regular compliance checks
3. **Staff Training:** Ensure staff understand data governance requirements
4. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive records of all governance activities
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and enhance controls

By implementing these controls through our Healthcare Data Governance Framework, organizations can establish a strong foundation for NHS compliance while protecting patient data and maintaining public trust.
