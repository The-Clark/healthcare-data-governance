# Healthcare Data Governance Framework - Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Healthcare Data Governance Framework, designed to implement NHS standards for data classification, quality monitoring, data lineage tracking, and GDPR compliance.

## System Architecture Overview

The framework is designed as a modular system with distinct components that work together to provide comprehensive data governance capabilities.

### Core Components

1. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Data ingestion and processing
   - Synthetic data generation for testing
   - Data storage and access controls

2. **Governance Layer**
   - Data classification engine
   - Data quality monitoring
   - Compliance controls
   - Lineage tracking

3. **Visualization & Reporting Layer**
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Compliance reporting
   - Governance metrics

## Component Details

### 1. Data Processing Layer

#### Data Sources
- Patient Demographics
- Medical Records
- Laboratory Results
- Consent Records
- Staff Records
- Audit Logs

These data sources are represented as CSV files for simplicity, but in a production environment, they would typically be connected to healthcare systems via APIs or database connectors.

#### Data Generation
The `data_generators` module provides synthetic healthcare data generation that mimics real NHS data structures without using any real patient data. This allows for testing and development without privacy concerns.

#### Data Storage
Data is stored in a simple file structure for this implementation. In a production environment, this would be replaced with appropriate database technologies with proper access controls.

### 2. Governance Layer

#### Data Classification Engine
The classification engine scans and categorizes data according to sensitivity levels:

- **PUBLIC**: Information that can be made public without restrictions
- **INTERNAL**: Non-sensitive information for internal use only
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Sensitive information with limited access
- **RESTRICTED**: Highly sensitive personal or clinical information

The engine automatically identifies personally identifiable information (PII) and special category data, assigning appropriate risk scores and handling requirements.

#### Data Quality Monitoring
The quality monitoring system evaluates data against NHS Data Quality Maturity Index dimensions:

- **Completeness**: The degree to which required data is present
- **Validity**: The degree to which data conforms to defined formats and ranges
- **Consistency**: The degree to which data is consistent across datasets
- **Timeliness**: The degree to which data is up-to-date
- **Uniqueness**: The degree to which data is free from duplication
- **Accuracy**: The degree to which data correctly describes the real-world object

Quality rules are applied automatically, producing quality scores and identifying issues requiring remediation.

#### Compliance Controls
GDPR compliance controls include:

- Consent management and tracking
- Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) generation
- Privacy notice management
- Data subject rights support
- Access control monitoring

These controls help ensure regulatory compliance with UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.

#### Lineage Tracking
The lineage tracking system maps relationships between datasets, tracks data flow, and provides impact analysis for potential changes:

- Dataset relationship detection
- Data flow visualization
- Access pattern analysis
- Change impact assessment

### 3. Visualization & Reporting Layer

#### Interactive Dashboard
The Streamlit-based dashboard provides:

- Executive summaries of governance metrics
- Data classification visualizations
- Quality monitoring reports
- Compliance status indicators
- Data lineage diagrams

#### Reporting
Automated reports include:

- Classification reports
- Data quality assessments
- Compliance status reports
- Lineage documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: SQLite (file-based)
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Great Expectations
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Documentation**: Markdown

```

### Data Flow

1. **Data Generation/Ingestion**:
   - Synthetic data is generated or real data is ingested
   - Data is stored in CSV format in the `data` directory

2. **Governance Processing**:
   - Data is classified according to sensitivity
   - Data quality is assessed against rules
   - Compliance controls are applied
   - Lineage relationships are mapped

3. **Reporting & Visualization**:
   - Results are stored in JSON format
   - Dashboard visualizes governance metrics
   - Documentation is generated

## Security Considerations

This framework implements several security controls:

1. **Data Classification**: Automatically identifies sensitive data
2. **Access Controls**: Simulates role-based access control
3. **Audit Logging**: Tracks all data access and modifications
4. **Encryption**: Recommends encryption for sensitive data (simulated)
5. **Data Minimization**: Identifies unnecessary data fields

For production implementation, additional security measures would include:

- Authentication and authorization integration
- Full encryption of sensitive data
- Network security controls
- Penetration testing and security auditing

## Deployment Considerations

While this framework is designed for local development and demonstration, a production deployment would require:

1. **Scalability**: Database and processing components that can handle healthcare data volumes
2. **Integration**: Connectors to existing healthcare systems
3. **High Availability**: Redundant systems for critical components
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Backup and recovery procedures
5. **Performance Optimization**: Tuning for large-scale data processing

## Compliance Architecture

The framework is designed to support NHS compliance requirements:

- **NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit**: Implements controls aligned with toolkit requirements
- **UK GDPR**: Provides mechanisms for all key GDPR principles
- **Caldicott Principles**: Supports the principles for protecting patient information
- **NHS Records Management Code of Practice**: Aligns with retention and management requirements

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed to be extensible:

1. **Additional Data Sources**: New connectors can be added for additional healthcare systems
2. **Enhanced Rules**: Quality and classification rules can be extended
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning components could be integrated
4. **Workflow Automation**: Remediation workflows could be added
5. **API Integration**: REST APIs could be provided for system integration
