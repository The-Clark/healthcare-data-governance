# Healthcare Data Governance Framework - Implementation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and using the Healthcare Data Governance Framework to implement NHS-aligned data governance practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- A virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/healthcare-data-governance.git
   cd healthcare-data-governance
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Framework Structure

The framework is organized into several components:

- **Data Generation**: Creates synthetic healthcare data
- **Data Classification**: Identifies and categorizes sensitive data
- **Quality Monitoring**: Assesses data quality against NHS standards
- **GDPR Compliance**: Implements privacy and compliance controls
- **Lineage Tracking**: Maps data relationships and flows
- **Dashboard**: Visualizes governance metrics and insights

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Generate Test Data

Generate synthetic NHS patient and healthcare data:

```bash
python src/data_generators/patient_data_generator.py
```

This will create several CSV files in the `data/` directory:
- `patient_demographics.csv`: Patient personal information
- `patient_medical_records.csv`: Medical treatment records
- `patient_lab_results.csv`: Laboratory test results
- `patient_consent_records.csv`: GDPR consent records
- `nhs_staff_records.csv`: Staff information
- `data_access_audit_logs.csv`: Data access logs

### Step 2: Run Data Classification

Classify data according to sensitivity levels:

```bash
python src/classification/data_classifier.py
```

This will:
- Scan all datasets and identify sensitive information
- Categorize data fields as PUBLIC, INTERNAL, CONFIDENTIAL, or RESTRICTED
- Generate classification reports in `data/classified/`

### Step 3: Assess Data Quality

Evaluate data against NHS quality standards:

```bash
python src/quality_monitoring/data_quality.py
```

This will:
- Validate data against predefined rules
- Generate data quality profiles
- Calculate quality scores
- Produce quality reports in `data/quality/`

### Step 4: Implement GDPR Compliance Controls

Run the GDPR compliance assessment:

```bash
python src/compliance_controls/gdpr_compliance.py
```

This will:
- Analyze consent records
- Generate a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
- Create a privacy notice template
- Analyze data access for compliance
- Generate compliance reports in `data/compliance/`

### Step 5: Track Data Lineage

Map data relationships and flows:

```bash
python src/lineage_tracking/data_lineage.py
```

This will:
- Detect relationships between datasets
- Create data flow visualizations
- Generate impact analyses
- Produce lineage documentation in `data/lineage/`

### Step 6: Launch the Dashboard

Start the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py
```

This will launch a web browser with the interactive governance dashboard where you can:
- View executive summaries
- Explore data classification results
- Monitor data quality
- Check GDPR compliance status
- Visualize data lineage

## Customization

### Modifying Data Generation

To customize the synthetic data:

1. Open `src/data_generators/patient_data_generator.py`
2. Adjust the following parameters:
   - `num_patients`: Change the number of patients to generate
   - `conditions`, `medications`, etc.: Modify the lists of conditions and medications
   - Data distributions: Adjust probabilities for various conditions

### Adding Custom Quality Rules

To add new data quality rules:

1. Open `src/quality_monitoring/data_quality.py`
2. Find the `_get_dataset_rules` method
3. Add new validation rules following this pattern:
   ```python
   "column_name": {
       "rule_name": rule_value,
       # Additional rules...
   }
   ```

### Extending Classification

To customize data classification:

1. Open `src/classification/data_classifier.py`
2. Modify the `classification_levels` dictionary to change sensitivity levels
3. Update the `pii_fields` and `clinical_fields` lists to adjust field categorization
4. Add or modify the regex patterns in the `patterns` dictionary

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

For effective governance:

1. **Run Daily**: Generate fresh data and run classification and quality checks daily
2. **Track Trends**: Monitor quality scores and compliance status over time
3. **Investigate Issues**: Follow up on low-quality scores or compliance failures

### Security Considerations

To enhance security:

1. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication for the dashboard in production
2. **Data Protection**: Encrypt all sensitive files in production environments
3. **Audit**: Regularly review the audit logs generated by the system

### Scaling for Production

To use this framework in production:

1. **Database**: Replace CSV files with a proper database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
2. **Authentication**: Add user authentication to the dashboard
3. **API Integration**: Connect to real healthcare systems instead of synthetic data
4. **Scheduling**: Set up automated runs using a scheduler like Airflow
5. **Monitoring**: Add alerting for governance issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Missing dependencies
**Solution**: Ensure all requirements are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Problem**: Dashboard not showing data
**Solution**: Check that you've generated data and run all governance tools first

**Problem**: Classification or quality checks fail
**Solution**: Verify CSV files exist in the data directory and have the expected format

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in the console for error messages
2. Review the JSON output files for specific error details
3. Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Dashboard Development

To customize the dashboard:

1. Modify `src/dashboard/app.py` to add new visualizations or pages
2. Use Streamlit components to create interactive elements
3. Connect to additional data sources as needed

### Integration with NHS Systems

For NHS integration:

1. Replace the data generation with connectors to real systems
2. Align classification levels with NHS Data Security standards
3. Implement NHS-specific audit requirements
4. Configure retention periods according to NHS records management
